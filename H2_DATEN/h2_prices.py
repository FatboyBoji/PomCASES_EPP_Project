# Daily patterns:
# Higher prices during peak demand hours (morning: 6-9am, evening: 5-8pm)
# Lower prices during night hours (11pm-5am)
# Medium prices during regular business hours
# Price relationship:
# Selling price should typically be 60-70% of buying price (your 3:5 ratio is good)
# Price variations should show some smoothness (avoid too many sudden jumps)


# Base price ranges (â‚¬/kg)
green_h2_price = np.random.uniform(4, 8, 24)  # Green hydrogen
blue_h2_price = np.random.uniform(2, 4, 24)   # Blue hydrogen

# Introduce fluctuations
fluctuations = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 24)) * 0.5  # Daily cycle

# Construct test data
c_hBuy = green_h2_price + fluctuations
c_hSell = c_hBuy * 0.6  # Assume selling price is 60% of buying price
